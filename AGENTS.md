# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI agents (and humans) working in this repository. This
is the marketing and documentation site for the Context Graph
Protocol — a Next.js (App Router) app managed with pnpm. `README.md`
is the authoritative source for the details.

## Local execution

Mac set this on 2026-09-26 for every repository on this machine. Local builds, test runs, dev servers, and git hooks ran the laptop out of memory and killed agent runs partway through, and every killed run costs money. CI is the only place code is built, checked, or tested.

- Do not run the gate, a build, a typecheck, a lint, or any test, not even one test file. Push the branch and read the CI result. Read a failed job with `gh run view --job <id> --log-failed`.
- Do not start a dev server: no `next dev`, `next start`, `pnpm dev`, a server under `cargo run`, or anything else that listens on a port.
- Do not start Docker or Colima, and do not run anything that needs them.
- Do not run Biome in any form.
- Git hooks are off on this machine. `LEFTHOOK=0` and `HUSKY=0` are set for every shell and every Claude Code session. Do not reinstall a hook, turn one back on, or run a hook's commands by hand.
- Code generators and small integrity scripts that only read and write files are allowed, such as regenerating a checksum, a schema index, or a message catalogue.
- Put this rule, word for word, in the prompt of every subagent you start.

## Agent-monitored pull requests

Mac set this on 2026-09-26 for every repository. The `agent-monitored-pr` label marks a PR that an agent watches until it merges or closes. A labelled PR comes before other work, and its fixes run in parallel wherever that is safe.

- **Label every PR an agent opens.** Pass `--label agent-monitored-pr` to `gh pr create`. If the repository has no such label, create it first: `gh label create agent-monitored-pr --color fd0880 --description "Agent polls every 60 seconds fixes CI, comments, conflicts."`
- **Poll the PR every 60 seconds.** Each poll reads the PR's state, its mergeability, the checks on the head commit, and every review thread with no inline reply after the reviewer's last comment. `gh pr view --json` does not return review threads, so read them with `gh api graphql` (`pullRequest.reviewThreads`).
- **Fix by review pass.** Pass N is the Nth review one reviewer submits on the PR. On pass 1, fix every P0, P1, and P2 finding. On pass 2, fix P0 and P1. From pass 3 on, fix P0 only. A P0 blocks the PR at every pass.
- **File one residue issue.** Carry every P1 and P2 finding left unfixed into a single issue for the PR. Its title ends with `(residue #<PR>)`, and its body links the PR. Reply inline on every thread you handle, with the commit that fixed it or a link to the residue issue.
- **Clear conflicts and CI failures as they appear.** When the PR conflicts, merge the base branch in, resolve it, and push. When a job fails, read its failing step with `gh run view --job <id> --log-failed`, fix it, and push without waiting for the rest of the run.
- **Dispatch subagents.** Give each independent fix its own subagent when no two fixes touch the same file. Stay active until the PR merges or closes.
- **Search for the label every 60 seconds.** A session that watches PRs runs `gh search prs --owner macanderson --label agent-monitored-pr --state open` every 60 seconds and takes each labelled PR that no live session owns. A PR has one writer. Two writers on one branch restart each other's CI and reject each other's pushes, so check `~/.claude/jobs/*/state.json` for an owner first, and message that session instead of pushing to its branch.

## Standing decisions — apply without asking

Each directive below is a Steering Context Record in [`docs/scr/`](docs/scr/);
the SCR is canonical — it carries the rationale, exceptions, and enforcement
status. This block is the compiled summary that every agent — Claude Code
(via CLAUDE.md's `@AGENTS.md` import) and Stella (which reads AGENTS.md
directly) — loads at session start. The corpus is identical across the
macanderson org repos.

- **[SCR-001](docs/scr/SCR-001-no-full-suite-builds.md) — Tests/builds
  (inner loop):** Never compile or run the full test suite while developing.
  Build and test only the crates/packages/modules touched by the change
  (plus direct dependents on interface changes). The full suite is CI's job.
  Here: CI runs `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm build` on every pull
  request. None of them runs on this machine, not even `pnpm vitest run` on
  one file.
- **[SCR-002](docs/scr/SCR-002-durability-first-architecture.md) —
  Architecture decisions:** Do not ask. Choose the most durable option — the
  one that can't be questioned in 10 years as the right move. Cheap-and-easy
  only wins when it is also the excellent durable choice. Record every such
  decision as an ADR in `docs/adr/`; the ADR replaces the question.
- **[SCR-003](docs/scr/SCR-003-dod-verified-close.md) — Definition of
  done:** An issue closes only when every DoD checklist item is satisfied
  and verified. Reference-grade includes tests, code comments, docs, and
  CI — not just the implementation. A PR that advances an issue without
  finishing it links it with `Refs #N` rather than `Closes #N`: `Refs`
  does not close, so the merge gate does not hold that PR against the
  issue's DoD. A PR may carry both, and is gated only on what it closes. A
  PR that closes nothing is waived by a label, and which one is a claim:
  `no-issue` for a trivial change, `closes-nothing` for a substantial one
  that closes no issue by design.
- **[SCR-004](docs/scr/SCR-004-residue-becomes-issues.md) — Fix over
  file:** Fix what you notice in the PR you are making; two unrelated fixes
  in one PR is fine. File an issue only when a fix cannot responsibly ride
  the PR (a maintainer decision, a rig or spend, or work larger than the
  session), and only when fixing it moves stability, reliability,
  maintainability, innovation, efficiency, or performance. Apply ONLY the
  `triage` label.
- **[SCR-005](docs/scr/SCR-005-triage-separation-of-duties.md) — Triage
  separation of duties:** Never apply priority (`P0`–`P3`) or size labels —
  a dedicated triage agent owns sizing and priority; a guard workflow
  strips creator-applied priorities.
- **[SCR-006](docs/scr/SCR-006-schema-changes-are-labelled.md) — Schema
  changes and migrations:** This repository has no persistent store, so
  SCR-006 is inert here. The `schema/` and `spec/` data in its shared bucket
  belong to the protocol repository, and a change to them needs no
  `migration-required` label. In a repo that owns a store, a pull request that
  changes a schema carries `migration-required`, and the migration reaches
  production before or with the deploy of that change, never after. Do not add
  an automatic apply to a deploy pipeline under this record; that is a
  separate decision, made per repo.
